## Introduction
This project is a basic steganography implementation using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method in C++. It allows users to encode a message into a BMP image by modifying the least significant bits of the pixel values, and decode the message later from the image. 

## Features
- **Encode Messages in Images**: Hides secret messages within the pixel data of BMP files.
- **Decode Messages from Images**: Extracts hidden messages from modified BMP files.
- **Simple Console-Based Interface**: Users can choose to encode or decode messages through simple terminal commands.

## How it Works
The project manipulates the least significant bit (LSB) of each byte in the BMP image file. This process is used to encode a message by converting it into binary and embedding it in the image. During decoding, the program reads the LSBs to reconstruct the original message.

- **Encoding**: Converts each character of the message into an 8-bit binary form and replaces the LSB of the image pixels with these bits.
- **Decoding**: Reads the LSBs of the image pixels, reconstructs the binary sequence, and converts it back to the original message.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/champst2004/steganography-cpp.git
cd steganography-cpp
```
### 2. Compile the Program
```bash
g++ project_main.cpp -o steganography
```
### 3. Run the Program
```bash
./steganography
```
### 4. Follow the On-Screen Prompts
Encode: Enter the message you want to hide in the image.  
Decode: Extract the hidden message from the encoded image.  
### 5. Example
```bash
1. Encode
Enter the message: Hello, World!
Message encoded in output.bmp
```
```bash
2. Decode
The message in the image is: Hello, World!
```
## Requirements
C++11 or higher  
Any C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)  
BMP image file for testing

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to implement basic steganography using C++ and bit manipulation. While it's a simple LSB technique, the project lays the foundation for more advanced steganography and cryptography techniques.
